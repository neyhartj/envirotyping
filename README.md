<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `envirotyping` package is meant to provide useful functions for
gathering and manipulating environmental data (weather, climate, soil
data, etc.) for use in quantitative genetic or plant breeding modeling
and predictions.

## Installation

To install this package, you can use `devtools` to install
`envirotyping` from its GitHub repository:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("neyhartj/envirotyping")
```

## Examples

The [package
vignette](https://neyhartj.github.io/envirotyping/articles/using_envirotyping.html)
demonstrates a complete workflow, including:

- Querying weather and soil data from remote databases
- Running a crop model
- Summarizing weather data by growth stages
- Creating an environmental covariance matrix
- Using environmental data in genomewide prediction
